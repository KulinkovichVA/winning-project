### Challenge
> Wilders have the power to travel back in time and bring all their technology with them. They can explore the period of their choice in order to create an application that can be perfectly adapted to the needs of the times.



### Journey
> We must have got kidnapped.
I can’t remember anything.
Just waking up somewhere,
we had never been before.
It was a very crowded place
it was noisy
it was people, animals and stuff everywhere.

**** 

We obviously travelled back in time -
to the Middle Ages.
We found ourselves in the middle of a market.
How is that possible?

****

We had no idea how we got here
and still less, how we should travel back.
So we decided to find something to eat and
a place to stay until we found out 
how to travel back to the future.

****

We are walking over the market.
It is wild trading all over the place.
Next to us, an old women is buying a chicken.
It’s head ist just cut off with an axe
blood all over the place.
That’s not what we prefer to have for lunch today.

****

We go on until we find this guy selling bread.
It looks like the best option for us.
But how should we pay?


Do you think he’s gonna accept ApplePay?
We brought nothing with us - 
except from our smartphones.

****

How do those people buy stuff without a smartphone?

We find a man, Robin, who is willing to explain the trading principles to us.

There is nothing like a currency.
Everything is about barter, that means:
bring sth to the market and change it for whatever you need.
Maybe bring more of whatever you have
since you never know what you will get in exchange today.

## And for sure, watch out to not to get pulled over the barrel!

## That is daily business

And it’s many people who already lost a lot by getting tricked.

…..

We are leaving the market to think about what Robin told us

## I think we can solve this issue and bring fairness into this world!



### Idea

There should be exchange rates,

being accessible for everyone.

Everyone should be able to know at every time

what he could get in exchange 

for what he wants to exchange.



## General info
We created an App to make trade in the Middle Ages fair.
The App is accessible for everyone.
It is as simple as possible to solve the problem of
no more getting pulled over the barrel from now on.

You can simply choose the product along with the amount,
you want to exchange, and the product you want to get
from a dropdown that shows you 
all the possible items for trading. 

Decide how many you have got for excahnge and
see how many you will get- today.

And always keep in mind that prices are fluctuating.
So be smart and watch the market!

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
